This project aims to predict miRNA/isomiRâ€“mRNA interactions using a hybrid deep learning model. Normal RNA Sequences, RNA secondary structure has been explored for this task. This repository includes initial data visualization, model implementation, training, evaluation, and final report â€” all built with bioinformatics research in mind.

Overview
We explore interaction prediction using advanced models with the following structure:

Data Analysis & Visualization (visualization.ipynb)

Model Training & Evaluation (main.ipynb)

Project Report (projectreport.pdf)

The final report follows the Bioinformatics Journal template and complies with the 7-page or 5000-word limit.

 Getting Started
ðŸ”§ Setup in Google Colab
Upload the project files (visualization.ipynb, main.ipynb, projectreport.pdf) to your Colab environment.

Load the dataset to the local session in Colab.

Run visualization.ipynb to perform data analysis and visualizations.

Run main.ipynb to train the model and visualize results.

Note: The project is configured for Colab, but you can also run it locally with appropriate GPU support.


 Training Tips
The current notebook is set to train for 10 epochs due to hardware limitations.

You are encouraged to increase the number of epochs if using a more powerful machine with better GPU support. More epochs typically yield better performance.

ðŸ“„ Project Report
You can find the project report in projectreport.pdf, which summarizes the motivation, methodology, results, and discussion â€” all within the constraints of the Bioinformatics Journal format.
